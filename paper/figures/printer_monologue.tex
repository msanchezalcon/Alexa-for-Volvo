        \item Reinstalling the print head.
        \item Caution: Make sure that the green carriage lock lever is STILL moved all the way forward before you reinstall the print head.
        \item 1. Line up the hole in the print head with the green post on the printer carriage.
        Lower the print head down gently into position.

        \item 4. Press and release the yellow LED button.
        \item The printer will prepare the cartridge for printing.
