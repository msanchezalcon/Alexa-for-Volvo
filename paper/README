To use the MLT Master's Thesis LaTeX template, you need to have a modern
TeX engine capable of using the fontspec package, such as LuaTeX or XeTeX.

You may also need to edit a few lines in the style file mlt-thesis-2015.sty,
to specify the fonts installed on your system. You need a roman font
(e.g. Times New Roman), a sans-serif font (e.g. Arial), a monospace
font (e.g. Courier New), and a narrow sans-serif font (e.g. Arial
Narrow). On Linux systems, there will typically be a selection of free
fonts instead of the above-mentioned fonts. Here is one example:

\newfontfamily\csffamily{Liberation Sans Narrow}
\setromanfont[Ligatures=TeX]{FreeSerif}
\setsansfont[Ligatures=TeX]{FreeSans}
\setmonofont[Ligatures=TeX]{FreeMono}

A few other packages are also used, but they should be available in
most LaTeX installations.

Contact Richard Johansson (richard.johansson@svenska.gu.se) if you
have any questions about how to use the template.
